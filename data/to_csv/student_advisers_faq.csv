Question,Response
How will compensation be applied in practice?,"Compensation will not be actioned by faculties. PC will be added to the student record by the Student Programmes team."
How does progression between semesters work?,"Progression decisions are made at the end of each academic year instead of every semester. Student Programmes will provide faculties with a list of students who have failed everything in the autumn semester. The faculty should contact these students to work out a program of study for the future. All other students will simply continue into the spring semester."
What are the changes in the honours admission criteria?,"There is no longer a formal 'admission to honours' process. Students are admitted to the university with the intention of completing an honours degree. Progression from year to year depends on meeting the minimum credit requirements."
What are the options for a student with 60 credits by the end of year 1?,"In order to progress to the next year of study, a full-time student must have attained a minimum of 80 credits by the end of year 1. The student cannot progress to year 2 and may require part-time study or a repeat semester depending on their degree program."
What happens if a student wants to withdraw from a module after the deadline for changes?,"The student will be short of credit and will need to make up the credit by taking an additional module. If the module is compulsory, it may affect the student's ability to progress with their degree program. An 'X' grade will appear on their record."
What advice should I give to a student who wants to change their intended degree one week into their studies?,"The student should speak to the adviser responsible for the degree program they wish to transfer into. The adviser should determine whether the change can be permitted and then email the Student Programmes team to request the change."
What should I do if a student wants to change a compulsory module which will change their intended degree?,"Discuss the degree program requirements with the student to consider whether a variant program will be required.

What should a student do if they fail their option module and it's not being offered again next academic session?,"The student will need to take a different option next year to make up their credit."
What does 4 assessment attempts (2 module registrations) mean?,"Students are permitted a maximum of 4 assessment attempts. A student who has not passed a compulsory module after exhausting their 4 attempts will need to change degree program."

What decisions can't I make as an adviser of studies?,"As an adviser, you cannot waive the requirement for a compulsory module, approve an extension to a student's completion date, change a student's year of study, approve a variant degree program without discussion with student programmes, or authorize compensation. Requests involving any of these should be passed to the Student Programmes team."
